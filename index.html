    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Julia Coronado, and I started attending SNHUâ€™s computer science program in 2020. This GitHub Pages site will display the work that I have completed during the program along with enhancements made to my final project.</p>

    <h2>Education Review</h2>
    <p>Completing my coursework for this degree helped me understand the importance of refining and polishing code in a professional manner. Through this process, I improved my ability to design structured, efficient, and scalable software applications. I also learned the value of version control, collaborative coding practices, and performance-focused enhancement strategies.</p>

    <h2>Enhancements Narrative</h2>

    <h3>Software Design and Engineering Enhancement</h3>
    <p>To improve the structure and maintainability of my food inventory application, I applied software design and engineering principles to refactor and organize the codebase. I implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, separated responsibilities across components, and created reusable utility classes. This enhanced the clarity and scalability of the application, making it easier to maintain and expand.</p>

    <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement</h3>
    <p>I optimized the data retrieval and filtering logic in the application by applying efficient algorithms. I introduced a HashMap for fast item lookup and improved the expiration check process using pre-sorted data and targeted comparisons. These changes significantly reduced processing time and improved user experience.</p>

    <h3>Database Enhancement</h3>
    <p>I redesigned the SQLite database schema by normalizing the structure and introducing foreign key constraints. This improved data integrity and eliminated redundancy. Separate tables for categories and units were created and linked via foreign keys, resulting in cleaner data management and faster queries.</p>

    <h2>Enhancement Video Presentation</h2>
    <p>The video below walks through my enhancement process in detail. It explains the technical improvements I made and how they contribute to a better user experience.</p>
