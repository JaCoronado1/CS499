    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>My name is Julia Coronado, and I began my journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University in 2021. This GitHub Pages site showcases the projects I‚Äôve completed throughout the program, including a featured final project enhanced through thoughtful design and code improvements that reflect the skills I‚Äôve developed along the way.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
<div class="card">
  <p>Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have grown both technically and professionally. This capstone experience allowed me to apply the full breadth of knowledge I‚Äôve gained‚Äîfrom foundational programming to system design, database management, and software engineering principles. By enhancing my final project, I demonstrated not only my ability to write clean, efficient code but also to think critically about performance, maintainability, and user experience.</p>
  
  <p>I have developed strong problem-solving skills through debugging complex issues, refactoring code, and optimizing data flow. Additionally, I‚Äôve improved my ability to communicate technical decisions clearly and professionally‚Äîskills I will carry into collaborative software development environments. This ePortfolio represents not just a culmination of coursework, but a confident step into my career as a software developer ready to contribute to real-world solutions.</p>

      <h3>üéØ Software Design and Engineering Enhancement</h3>

      </p>
      <p>To improve the structure and maintainability of my food inventory application, I applied software design and engineering principles to refactor and organize the codebase. Initially, much of the business logic, UI interaction, and data handling were all contained within a single activity, leading to tightly coupled and hard-to-maintain code. I redesigned the project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, separating data handling from the user interface and core logic. I also created reusable helper classes and modular components to improve readability and scalability, making the application easier to update and maintain in the future.</p>

      <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement</h3>

      <p>The original application used simple, linear search techniques to filter and sort inventory items. As the dataset grew, performance issues began to emerge. To address this, I optimized the expiration check algorithm by pre-sorting inventory data by date and applying a sliding window filter to focus only on soon-to-expire items. I also introduced a HashMap to categorize and retrieve items more efficiently based on their properties, allowing for constant-time access. These enhancements reduced the application's load time and significantly improved user experience when managing large inventories.</p>

    <section class="card" id="db-enhancement">
      <h3>üóÑÔ∏è Database Enhancement</h3>

        </a>
      <p>To strengthen the application‚Äôs data layer, I redesigned the SQLite database schema for better normalization and scalability. The original design stored category and unit data directly in the items table, which risked data redundancy and inconsistencies. I refactored the schema by creating separate tables for categories and units, then implemented foreign key relationships to link them to the inventory table. I also added constraints and indexes to enforce data integrity and improve query performance, making the database structure more robust and efficient for future expansion.</p>
