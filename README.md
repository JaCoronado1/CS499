# CS499 Computer Science Capstone   
**April, 2022**


## Overview

This repository documents my process for developing my ePortfolio as part of the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course. My final project centers on a mobile application built in Android Studio using SQLite, designed to help users manage and track their food inventory. 

Creating this project allowed me to demonstrate a variety of skills related to software design and engineering, data management, and user interface development. The artifacts presented here show the evolution of the application through a series of planned enhancements, each addressing real-world user needs or technical improvements.

The ePortfolio reflects my ability to build, refactor, and improve applications using professional software development practices. It also highlights my capability to self-assess and enhance project components with a focus on usability, performance, and code quality.
