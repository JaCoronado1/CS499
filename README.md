## Overview

This repository documents my procedures for developing my ePortfolio as the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. Creating a professional portfolio that showcases my unique abilities and talents is one of the best visual communication tools to demonstrate our value to potential employers. 

The content of the ePortfolio is a solid starting point to clarify ideas that showcase my skills across key fields of Computer Science. The included artifacts from the program represent my growth in the key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Some artifacts demonstrate my skills in one category and illustrate growth across others. The artifacts chosen have been enhanced beyond the original course requirements to establish a high quality of work, address limitations, and reduce vulnerabilities. The portfolio communicates that I am strongly motivated, well-organized, and accomplished in the Computer Science program with a focus in Software Engineering.
